    <h1>Description</h1>
    <img src="pizza.jpg" width="500px" alt="Tasty Pizza" />
    <p>
      Here is the archetype of a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita
      adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag: green from basil, white
      from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta’s
      restaurant in Brooklyn, who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing
      together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched</li>
      <li>3tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2¾ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
      <li>4 to 5basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn
        heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a
        spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately ½
        inch from the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large
        pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over
        the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone
        or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the
        cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.
