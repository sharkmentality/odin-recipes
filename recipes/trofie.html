    <p>
      Basil pesto is truly one of the wonders of the world. Simple yet
      flavorful, this Italian classic brings out the beautiful flavor of basil
      and garlic. Pine nuts and parmesan cheese add a rich nuttiness that
      perfectly constants the kick of heat from the red pepper flakes.

      Altogether, it is a bright, colorful, and flavor-packed sauce that fits
      excellently into the grooves of Handmade Trofie pasta. Both the handmade
      pasta and sauce can be whipped up from scratch in under an hour. A boujee
      homemade Italian dinner in less than 60 minutes?! YES SIR/MA’AM!
